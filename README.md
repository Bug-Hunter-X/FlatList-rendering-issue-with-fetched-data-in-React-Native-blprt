# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common but elusive bug in React Native involving the `FlatList` component when rendering data fetched from an API.  The issue manifests inconsistently, sometimes displaying data correctly and other times showing nothing or only a partial list.

## Bug Description

The `DataFetch` component fetches user data from a public API. The intention is for a `FlatList` to display the first names of the users.  However, the `FlatList` component often fails to render the data correctly, even though the API call succeeds and the data is available in the component's state.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on a simulator or physical device (make sure you have the necessary React Native environment set up).
3. Observe the inconsistent rendering of the `FlatList`.  It may work correctly on some runs, and not others.

## Solution

The solution involves addressing potential race conditions and ensuring the data is consistently available before rendering the FlatList. Check `DataFetchSolution.js` for a potential fix.
